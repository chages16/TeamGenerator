## User-Story
```
AS A manager
I WANT a Team generator
SO THAT can quickly create a professional employee profject for a new project
```

## Installation
            
You can install the system by cloning the repository onto your home computer. Then from the root folder, install the required dependencies and open the application with node app.js

## Technology

* [NPM Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/)

## Challenges
The main issue at the moment is that the render function doesn't seem to recognise the functions within the Employee.js/ Manager.js etc. classes. I've tried altering the code for the classes and playing around with Jest but each time I get a different error. I plan on continue to working on this but haven't been able to proceed with the application at this point.

I'm hoping I can have the application working over the next week, and am disappointed I wasn't able to figure out the solution.


## Version
1.0.0


## Future-Development
* Fix the export and complete the design of the application.
* An open file option at the end of the application so that the user can make further changes
* More customisation options/ fix the code in app.js as it seems like some data is still missing.
